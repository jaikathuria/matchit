# Memory Game

The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.

## Gameplay:

* A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## How to open the Game:
